         A player rolls two dice. Each die has six faces that contain
         one, two, three, four, five and six spots, respectively. The 
         sum of the spots on the two upward faces is calculated. If the
         sum is 7 or 11 on the first throw, the player wins. If the sum
         is 2, 3 or 12 on the first throw (called "craps"), the player 
         loses (i.e., the "house" wins). If the sum is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 
         10 on the first throw, that sum becomes the player’s "point." 
         To win, you must continue rolling the dice until you "make your
         point" (i.e., roll your point value). You lose by rolling a 7 
         before making the point.
