<i>Visual C# 2010 How to Program, 4th Edition </i> incorporates an easy-to-follow, carefully developed early classes and early objects approach with comprehensive coverage of the fundamentals of object-oriented programming. It includes an optional automated teller machine (ATM) case study that teaches the fundamentals of software engineering and object-oriented design with the UML.
