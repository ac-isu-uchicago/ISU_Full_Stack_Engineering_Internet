<i>Internet and World Wide Web How to Program, 5th edition</i> introduces students with little or no programming experience to the exciting world of Web-based applications. The book has been substantially reworked to 
reflect today's Web 2.0 rich Internet application-development methodologies. A comprehensive book that 
teaches the fundamentals needed to program on the Internet, this text provides in-depth coverage of introductory programming principles, various markup languages (HTML5, CSS3 and XML), several scripting languages
(JavaScript and PHP), Ajax, web services, Web servers (IIS and Apache) and relational databases (MySQL/Apache Derby/Java DB)-all the skills and tools needed to create dynamic Web-based applications. The text contains comprehensive introductions to ASP.NET  and JavaServer Faces (JSF). Hundreds of live-code examples of real applications throughout the book allow readers to run the applications and see and hear the outputs. The book provides instruction on building Ajax-enabled rich Internet applications that enhance the presentation of online content and give web applications the look and feel of desktop applications. After mastering the material in this book, students will be well prepared to build real-world, industrial-strength, Web-based applications.
