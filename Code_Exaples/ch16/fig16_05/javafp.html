<p>The professional programmer’s Deitel® guide to Java™ development and the powerful Java platform
Written for programmers with a background in high-level language programming, this book applies the Deitel signature live-code approach to teaching programming and explores the Java language and Java APIs in depth. The book presents concepts in the context of fully tested programs, complete with syntax shading, code highlighting, line-by-line code walkthroughs and program outputs. The book features 200+ complete Java programs with 18,000+ lines of proven Java code, and hundreds of tips that will help you build robust applications.
 <p>Start with an introduction to Java using an early classes and objects approach, then rapidly move on to more advanced topics, including GUI, graphics, exception handling, generics, collections, JDBC™, web-application development with JavaServer™ Faces, web services and more. You’ll enjoy the Deitels’ classic treatment of object-oriented programming and the OOD/UML® ATM case study, including a complete Java implementation. When you’re finished, you’ll have everything you need to build object-oriented Java applications.
