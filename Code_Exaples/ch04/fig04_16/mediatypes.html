      <h1>CSS Media Types Example</h1>
   
      <p>
         This example uses CSS media types to vary how the page
         appears in print and how it appears on any other media.
         This text will appear in one font on the screen and a
         different font on paper or in a print preview. To see
         the difference in Internet Explorer, go to the Print
         menu and select Print Preview. In Firefox, select Print
         Preview from the File menu.
