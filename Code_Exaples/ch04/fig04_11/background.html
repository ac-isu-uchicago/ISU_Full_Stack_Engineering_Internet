         This example uses the background-image, 
         background-position and background-attachment
         styles to place the <span class = "dark">Deitel 
         & Associates, Inc.</span> logo in the  
         bottom-right corner of the page. Notice how the logo 
         stays in the proper position when you resize the 
         browser window. The background-color fills in where
         there is no image.
